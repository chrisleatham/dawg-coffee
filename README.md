# Responsive Challenge: Dawg Coffee

This folder contains your submission for the [responsive challenge](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/responsive). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
> http://students.washington.edu/chris13/info343/dawg-coffee/

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> My friend Michael Andrea (not in this class but an Info major) helped me with some basic things that I wasn't understanding. I emailed Mike and he helped me find a semi-colon that I was missing. I also went to w3schools and stack overflow as well as youtube videos for somethings that I was not understanding.

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> Nah, I didn't know how. 

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> Longer than it probably should have taken. I am really new to this stuff. I honestly spent probably around 12 hours trying to get it done. When ever I wasn't in class I was sitting at my computer trying to figure this out.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> My computer monitor is really wide, and I think that affected setting up some things because the resolution made things look off. But on a different monitor of the same size, it looked right. So I would just look at that maybe. Also have another day of class explaining this challenge rather than having everything crammed into one day.
